# What's the Weather Like?

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

In this project is a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. This was accomplished by utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Part 2 contains using weather data to plan future vacations. Utilzed jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.
